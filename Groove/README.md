MINI BEAT BOARD

An application where you can create your own beat/music. 
Something that I didn't tackle is recording only the audio (beats/notes) that were played.  The microphone picks up everything that is receivced thus the audio is not a clean segment of the music clip.
A solution that I hypothesize that can tackle this problem is record not the audio that is played at that moment, but rather push the keys that were pressed into an array and then record/play the array. 

Some sources I used to create this small app: 
- @MattDiamond's JS library for recording video
- @WesBos coding challenge
- pinkyfinger for the piano notes at ( https://freesound.org/people/pinkyfinger/ )
