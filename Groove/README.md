MINI BEAT BOARD

An application where you can create your own beat/music. 
Something that I was unable to tackle is how the audio does not pick up only the beats/notes that were played.  The microphone picks up everything that is receivced thus the audio is not a clean segment of the music clip.

Some sources I used to create this small app: 
- @MattDiamond's JS library for recording video
- @WesBos coding challenge
- pinkyfinger for the piano notes at ( https://freesound.org/people/pinkyfinger/ )
